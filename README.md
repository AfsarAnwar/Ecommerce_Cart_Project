# Ecommerce_Cart_Project
This is a Java-based web application for a simple shopping cart system, developed using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC. It allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, and place orders after logging in.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Users must log in to place an order. Session management is used to maintain user sessions.
Product Catalog: Displays available products to users, with options to add items to the cart.
Shopping Cart: Utilizes a LinkedList to manage the shopping cart, supporting adding and removing items.
JDBC Integration: Uses JDBC for database operations, such as user authentication and order storage.
Object-Oriented Principles: Implements inheritance and type casting to manage various entities like users, products, and orders.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions across multiple pages, ensuring users can continue shopping without re-authenticating.
List Interface: Leverages the List interface for dynamic data structures and cart management.
Tech Stack:
Java, JSP, Servlets
JDBC for database connectivity
MySQL (or any other DBMS of your choice)
HTML/CSS for frontend
Bootstrap
